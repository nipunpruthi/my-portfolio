Hey, I'm **Nipun**! üëã

I'm a backend engineer, skating enthusiast, and avid traveller. I've done my bachelors from **Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Roorkee** and have been building distributed systems for 5+ years.

Currently working as **Senior Software Engineer at [Ixigo](https://www.ixigo.com)**, India's largest Online Travel Agency (OTA) by user count, where I architect systems that handle millions of travel searches daily.

Before Ixigo, I spent 2 years building scalable platforms at **[Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com)** and **[Tide](https://www.tide.co)**, gaining experience across e-commerce and fintech domains.

I'm always up for conversation over a cup of tea (green). ‚òï

## What I Do

I specialize in **backend engineering** with a focus on:

- **Distributed Systems**: Designing resilient architectures that handle high-scale traffic
- **API Development**: Building robust, performant APIs using Go and modern frameworks
- **System Design**: Architecting scalable solutions for complex business problems
- **Performance Optimization**: Making systems faster, more efficient, and cost-effective

## My Journey

My career has been focused on solving complex distributed systems challenges:

**At [Ixigo](https://www.ixigo.com)** - Building travel search infrastructure that processes 10M+ queries during peak seasons, optimizing for both speed and cost efficiency.

**At [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com)** - Developed e-commerce platform features serving 100M+ monthly active users, focusing on seller onboarding and catalog management systems.

**At [Tide](https://www.tide.co)** - Built financial technology solutions for SME banking, handling high-volume transaction processing and real-time payment systems.

**Core expertise**: Go, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, AWS, and microservices architecture.

## Technical Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Simple, maintainable code** over clever complexity
- **Data-driven decisions** backed by metrics and monitoring  
- **Collaborative engineering** through mentoring and knowledge sharing
- **Continuous learning** to stay ahead of evolving technologies

## Beyond Engineering

When I'm not architecting distributed systems:

- üõπ **Skating** through the streets and exploring new spots
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Traveling** to discover new cultures and cuisines
- üçÉ **Green tea sessions** while reading about tech and planning side projects

## Let's Connect

Whether you want to discuss **distributed systems architecture**, **Go programming**, **system design patterns**, or just chat about the latest **skating spots** and **travel destinations** over green tea - I'm always up for a good conversation!

Feel free to reach out if you're working on interesting backend challenges or have opportunities in building scalable systems.
